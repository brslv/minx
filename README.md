# Minx

A simple, minimalist, distraction-free tasks application. 

It's basically a single-page app, built entirely with vanilla js. It's core purpose is to practice some interesting javascript (pre ES6) techniques and patterns. As I like to say - for learning purposes.

Otherwise it's good to keep track of the tasks for the day.
